Code for: Microstructural and functional plasticity following repeated brain stimulation during cognitive training in non-demented older adults

For transparency and in order to reconstruct/ replicate our results, we upload the R script (XXX) to analyse the data we used within our manuscript (Source_Data.xlsx).
The data file contains different named excel sheets. The first sheet contains all data we used for statistical analyses und for visualization. In addition, we created separate files for each figure/ table which only contains necessary information for that representation. 

To run the R script, you need to: 
- install R (http://www.rproject.org/)
- install the required packages to run the analysis (can be found in the first lines of the R script)
- dowload the data and set the working directory to your own directory
